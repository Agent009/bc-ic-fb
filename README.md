## Family Bank Explained
### What is it?

A family bank is a **fund** managed by closely-related and/or value-aligned members of a family, group, society or organisation.
The primary goal of the fund is to **grow wealth** collectively through **investments** by managing a diversified portfolio.
A secondary goal is to allow members to take out a **loan** for various purposes such as emergency spending, house purchase deposit, car purchase, etc. 

**Disclaimer:** Our implementation promotes a **goodly interest-free loan**, also known as [**Qard-al-Hasan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qard_al-Hasan) in *Islamic Jurispudence*. We are strictly against **interest** of any kind, so our implementation makes no effort to support this monetary vehicle.

The major **components** of the family bank are the following:

* [Funds](#fund)
* [Members](#member)
* [Pots](#pot)
* [Transactions](#transaction)

#### Fund

Umbrella structure referring to the assets under management for a group of users. The fund comprises of **members**, **pots**, **transactions** and **assets**.

#### Member

Participating users within a **fund**. Members can have various roles such as **head**, **fund manager**, and **contributor**.

#### Pot

A defined **segment within a fund element, e.g., loan pot, debt repayment pot, etc.

#### Transaction

A record capturing the state of incoming and outgoing assets, as well as intermediary transformations such as currency conversions, stock purchase and sales, and realised losses.

### Utilising ckBTC

* Moving assets between **pots** frictionlessly and with minimal fees.

## Setup
### Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://{asset_canister_id}.localhost:4943`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run prebuild
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

#### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

### Resolving [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) Issues

* Add `http://127.0.0.1:*` in `src/fb_frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5`

```bash
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self';script-src 'self';connect-src 'self' http://127.0.0.1:* http://localhost:* https://icp0.io https://*.icp0.io https://icp-api.io;img-src 'self' data:;style-src * 'unsafe-inline';style-src-elem * 'unsafe-inline';font-src *;object-src 'none';base-uri 'self';frame-ancestors 'none';form-action 'self';upgrade-insecure-requests;"
```

#### Resolving 403 Issues

In the **local** environment, this is usually due to using the network Internet Identity provider instead of using the [local instance](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-3/3.5-identities-and-auth#importing-the-auth-client-package).

In the front-end canister, change the `auth-client` **identityProvider** over to: `${ii_canister_id}.localhost:4943#authorize`

Also:

* Use URLs of the format `http://{asset_canister_id}.localhost:4943` instead of `http://localhost:4943/?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`
* For candid, you would use the following URL: `http://{candid_canister_id}.localhost:4943/?id={target_canister_id}`

## Roadmap

* **SNS DAO** implementation to make owners of funds governance token the custodians of their respective funds.
* **DEX** integration to enable hassle-free swaps for managing the investment portfolio.
